## notes for michael so he doesn't forget how to test the bot:
- clone the repo
- npm install
- go to discord devleoper portal and get a copy of the bot token
- create a .env file containing the following
  - DISCORD_TOKEN=your-token-goes-here
  - APP_ID=your-app-id-goes-here
  - GUILD_ID=guild-id-goes-here_ which you get by right clicking on channel icon -> copy server id
  - STEAM_API_KEY= which you get by going to https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
  - DEADLOCK_API_KEY= which you get by asking michael
- node index.js
- if registering new slash methods, then node deploy-commands.js
