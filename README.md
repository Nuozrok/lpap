# lpap
lpap.app in development


## Hardware
- cheap sbc (like raspberry pi?) or intel nuc or mini pc. Low power and cheap.

## Hosting - LPAP.APP
- GitHub pages?
- Google domain? https://domains.google.com/registrar/search?hl=en&searchTerm=lpap.app

## Ideas
- SECURE LOGIN
- Login via discord? https://discordjs.guide/oauth2/#setting-up-a-basic-web-server seems to cover it pretty well but haven't tried this yet
- Discord bot tried this, easiest step so far, https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started literally was able to do this on a test server in 30 minutes
^^ using discord's api directly is hurting my eyes so going to start using discord.js to abstract that and use more normal object oriented stuff


- Picture of the day with bot integration  maybe https://discordjs.guide/oauth2/#setting-up-a-basic-web-server, maybe https://discordjs.guide/oauth2/#setting-up-a-basic-web-server , less clear
(post in \#general or new channel?)
- Photo gallery 
- Music playlists
- Discord Chat log
- File sharing?
- Event calendar
- Mtg Library
- Common games matrix (scan steam libraries, origin, blizzard, etcâ€¦) with randomizer to pick a game depending on who is selected https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetOwnedGames_.28v0001.29 
- Movie night? Submit suggestion (limit 1) rotate who picks each session

ngrok http 3000 to open up a port locally
